- zindex. painful. there's no fix in getting fancy with conditionally using one
zindex over another when move "up" - the problem is that the zindex is applied
before the avatar element has moved out of it's previous node.

a smarter fix would be to ask "are my bottom edges equal to or greater than
the bottom edges of the node i'm entering - if they are, that's the time to adjust
my zindex".

only a problem with following a pathway smoothly, of course.

to be fair, "base" tiles should always have a lower z-index than the avatar.

but the zindex problem reappears when items are placed on base tiles (like
buildings).

ideas:
look at flash book for zindex stuff
